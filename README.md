## || Day 1 || Points - Hong Kong Lampposts Map
![Hong Kong Lampposts Map](maps/day1/Wallpaper.png)

A collection of lampposts in Hong Kong that are found in the now open dataset Digital Topogrphic Map iB1000. Interestingly as we have lampposts that are relatively closer to other major cities, the lampposts can really become an impressionist tool to illustrate public roads in Hong Kong.

🗺 Data: iB1000 Utility Point, Lands Department Hong Kong.

🔨🔧 Tools and Steps: QGIS, points feature blending hard light

## || Day 2 || Lines - HK Tramways

A quick render of the iconic tram tracks on the Hong Kong Island. It was mostly built along the coastline around 100 years ago and has become a reminder of the natural coastline. My grandma would travel from East side to West side, to buy kilos of rice and carry it back on tram due to its cheap fare.

🗺 Data: iB5000 Rail Line, Lands Department Hong Kong.

🔨🔧 Tools and Steps: QGIS, hillshade styling for DEM, line styling for rail

## || Day 4 || Hexagons - Hong Kong Buildings in Hexagons

Summary of number of buildings grouped into hexagons in Hong Kong, each hexagon is 3km wide.

🗺 Data: iB5000 Buildings Point, Lands Department Hong Kong. Digital Terrain Model, Lands Department Hong Kong.

🔨🔧 Tools and Steps: QGIS, create grid, summarize building points in hexagon, calculate max elevation from DEM, change to gradual symbols and add border layer to simple fill.
