## || Day 1 || Points
![Hong Kong Lampposts Map](maps/day1/Wallpaper.png)

A collection of lampposts in Hong Kong that are found in the now open dataset Digital Topogrphic Map iB1000. Interestingly as we have lampposts that are relatively closer to other major cities, the lampposts can really become an impressionist tool to illustrate public roads in Hong Kong.

🗺 Data: iB1000 Utility Point, Lands Department Hong Kong.

🔨🔧 Tools and Steps: QGIS, points feature blending hard light

## || Day 2 || Lines
![Hong Kong Tram Line](maps/day2/Wallpaper.png)

A quick render of the iconic tram tracks on the Hong Kong Island. It was mostly built along the coastline around 100 years ago and has become a reminder of the natural coastline. My grandma would travel from East side to West side, to buy kilos of rice and carry it back on tram due to its cheap fare.

🗺 Data: iB5000 Rail Line, Lands Department Hong Kong.

🔨🔧 Tools and Steps: QGIS, hillshade styling for DEM, line styling for rail
